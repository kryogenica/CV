ðŸš€ OpenForecast â€“ a powerful tool I developed to try to predict stock prices using machine learning! ðŸ“Š

OpenForecast is a Streamlit-based web app that helps users predict future stock prices using machine learning. The app identifies the 3 closest matching pre-market prices from the past 30 days, comparing them to the current or most recent pre-market data. The open market prices corresponding to these 3 best matches are then used to forecast future trends.

The idea is that pre-market prices often reflect investor sentiment and major market-moving events that occur outside regular trading hours, providing early insights into potential market direction. By using these to select previous open trading days, the model can better capture short-term volatility and patterns (mainly at opening time) that might influence future price movements.

It's designed for real-time stock price analysis and visualization, making it a simple yet powerful tool for financial forecasting. Prediction tools will be improved as time goes on.

Check it out on Streamlit and let me know your thoughts! ðŸ”—
