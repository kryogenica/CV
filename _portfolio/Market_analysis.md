This was a simple personal project to learn crypto market behaviours, indicators and explore correlations in the data.
Used Gdax API (Coinbase) to gather historical data on ethereum. Produced bollinger lines, moving averages, searched for big price changes in the data.
Used the latter to see the correlations in times series data points immedietly before a spike in price change.
Predicted the moving of prices using RBF kernel within a Support Vector Machine.
