Research Interests
======
* Data science, data analysis, and data reporting.
* Machine learning, specially graph neural networks.
* Reinforcement learning & integer linear programming optimization.
* Brain, financial, social, & car-traffic networks.
* Simulating complex systems / physics through equations.
* Infereing network structure from its dynamics 🕸️ &harr; 〰️.

Recent Personal Projects
======
* [**Open-Forecast**](https://open-forecast.streamlit.app/)
  * A fintech web app built with Streamlit, designed to forecast stock prices using machine learning. It analyzes pre-market data to predict price trends.
* [**Contextual Search: A RAG Tool**](https://github.com/kryogenica/Contextual_Search_Tool)
  * A search engine powered by a fine-tuned DistilBERT model that enables contextual searches within movie scripts. This tool uses Python scripts for scene extraction and embedding generation.

Award
======
Secured a prestigious [SBIR Phase I grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2309896) from the National Science Foundation along with my PhD Principal Investigator for pioneering an artificial intelligence system to enhance transparency and predict trends in democratic elections.

Work experience
======
* Machine Learning Engineer - Contract (June 2024 - August 2024)
  * Developed an industry-first dataset by leveraging AWS and Azure large language models (LLMs) to generate and augment data from movie scripts, enabling content extraction and analysis. Employed prompt engineering to minimize paraphrasing and ensure structured output in the desired JSON format. This dataset was subsequently used to fine-tune a custom Named-Entity Recognition (NER) transformer model, driving accuracy in entity recognition and establishing a new standard for movie script data processing.
 
* Graduate Center of CUNY, PhD in Physics (Sept 2019 - August 2024)
  * **Project: Bridging the gap between physics, network theory and neuro-science:**
    * Collaborated with a multidisciplinary and international team to guide their sourcing of neural activity signals and preprocessing it resulting in an ETL pipeline leading to a prime dataset providing the basis for high quality research.
    * Applied advanced concepts of graph theory to study the complex network of a worm's brain, leading to the identification of key structures responsible for synchronization and writing one of the first papers on how a particular type of network symmetry may lurk in the brain's structure. Calculations done via NetworkX and Pandas.
  * **Project: A/B testing of optimal network repairing algorithms with statistical support:**
    * Applied dozens of statistical measuring techniques on the dataset collected above to capture relational information, transformed each into a unique developed data structure, implemented various community detection algorithms on each, producing a plethora of options to be tested. Filtered results via p-value permutation tests and reproducibility of results to test robustness of the pipeline... [**(more in CV)**](/files/Bryant_Avila_CV.pdf)

* Kcore Analytics, Data Analyst (Nov 2023 – April 2024)
  * Built new calls not offered in the US census bureau python library via their API to retrieve demographic data on multiple resolution levels, stored data into custom SQL tables prior to GeoPandas calculations. Created a Selenium based web crawler tailored towards specific websites for data extraction.
  * Implemented pre-trained transformers to do sentiment analysis on retrieved tweets, incorporating results with aforementioned population data to infer election outcomes via the training of multiple convolutional graph neural network models via PyTorch.

* Fashion Institute of Technology, Principal Lab Technician (Feb 2018 – Feb 2024)
  * Administered a yearly budget of over $100K, ensuring efficient allocation towards upgrades, chemical and equipment purchasing, and training initiatives. Successfully captured internal funds to spearhead the integration of 3D printing technology in the classroom, enhancing the practical learning experience for students. Led and managed team of staff members.
  * Collaborated with faculty in pioneering the development of sustainable materials, including bacterial leather, alginate & mushroom fabrics, and mycelium wood. Conducted detailed characterization of biological samples using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and diligently reported findings relevant for further advancement...
